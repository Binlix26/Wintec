A man who killed his partner after subjecting her to months of abuse is aiming to have his prison sentence reduced because of his age, his remorse and a mathematical error by a judge.

But the Crown says Jessie John Ferris-Bromley, 23, should be stuck with his eight-year jail term for the manslaughter of Virginia Ford.

Ferris-Bromley was not in the Court of Appeal in Wellington on Thursday to hear the arguments for and against his appeal, but Ford's Dunedin-based family made the trip.
